You can also plop things in here that will be used to implement certain types
of actions. There is an example file in here called copy.makefile that
implements a copy action. You can use it by including it in your .scmrc file
and then things will be released using that action. You can write your own
actions like one to deploy Perl scripts or Python scripts or one to talk to a
remote server and build a virtual environment and load your stuff into it. The
possibilities are endless.
